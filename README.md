## Description of the project
This is a C++ console app created for warehouse administration. It gives you the ability to get the amount/info/price/history of any item that is currently in your warehouse or has been in your warehouse before. You can also import how many of each item is imported or exported out of the warehouse and see data related to that on each of the items.
